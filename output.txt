LONDON -- one of the most anodyne election campaign in live memory have leave Britain with a result that few expect -- and one that could transform Britain both internally and externally . this be a election that recast the political geography of Britain . it may redraw the boundary of the nation . and it raise question about the future shape of the European Union . it be conceivable , give the astonishing success of the Scottish National Party , that this may be one of the last election of a United Kingdom . it be also conceivable , give the Conservative Party 's pledge to hold a referendum on European Union membership , that it may be the last general election in which Britain be a member of the union . David Cameron and Conservatives get Majority in British ElectionMAY 8 , 2015 pollster and pundit have for week be predict a tight result , with no party receive a majority , labour and conservative neck and neck , and the nation face day , perhaps week , of political negotiation to stitch together a new coalition government . instead , the conservative have gain a absolute majority in Parliament . the junior coalition party in the previous government , the Liberal Democrats , be effectively wipe off the electoral map , retain just eight of its 57 seat . the Labour Party suffer , if anything , a even greater catastrophe . Labour have expect to be the largest party ; its leader have be talk bullishly in the past few day of form the next government at the head of a grand anti-tory coalition . instead , labour have 26 seat fewer today -- its worst result in nearly 30 year . the biggest winner be the Scottish National Party . last September , it decisively lose the referendum for scottish independence . on Thursday , it take 56 of Scotland 's 59 parliamentary seat , a political tidal wave that wash away labour north of the border . how the new conservative government deal with the scottish question will be one of the dominant issue in the coming month . before the election , with most commentator expect a indecisive result , there be widespread discussion about the issue of legitimacy : would a minority government , or a coalition of disparate party , have a genuine mandate to govern ? Thursday 's result may have prevent the fear constitutional wrangling , but it have raise deeper question of legitimacy . `` I want to reclaim the mantle that we should never have lose , '' Prime Minister David Cameron tell fellow conservative Thursday night , `` the mantle of one nation , one United Kingdom . '' but no party can any longer claim that mantle . over recent decade , support for all the major party have geographically fragmented . whatever Mr. Cameron 's desire , the Conservatives no longer constitute a `` one nation '' party . it be effectively the party of England , and more especially of southern England . from the 1930s to the 1950s , the Conservatives be the dominant force in Scotland , win more than half the vote in some election . as late as 1992 , the party take more than a quarter of the vote and hold 11 seat there . in this Parliament , as in the last , there be just one scottish conservative member . the Labour Party possess even less of a national presence . from be the prevail political force in Scotland , it have be all but wipe out , retain , like the Conservatives , just one seat . and in England , it have be force back into its heartland in London , the Midlands and the North . even here , it now face a new threat . the populist anti-immigration , anti-european U.K. Independence Party poll strongly in many traditional labour area in the north of England and even in Wales . come the next election , it may well challenge labour in these constituency . the legitimacy of Britain 's electoral system be also now under scrutiny . the first-past-the-post system work relatively well while british politics revolve around two main party . there be never a perfect fit between the proportion of vote that the labour or Conservative Party receive and the number of parliamentary seat they gain , yet the relationship be close enough in a rough-and-ready way to give the system legitimacy . Britain , however , be grow more fragmented in its political outlook . as the two-party system have mutate into a multiparty democracy , the electoral arrangement be produce highly skewed result . the Scottish National Party , for instance , win a little less than 1.5 million vote last night and 56 seat . UKIP win more than twice as many vote but have just one member of Parliament . the problem of legitimacy run deeper , though , than simply the technicality of the electoral system . the election highlight the party that voter reject more than it reveal the one they support . the anomaly of the conservative victory be that the policy of the last coalition government be deeply unpopular . many voter , however , fear labour more than they loathe the Tories . one of the reason all the opinion poll be so wrong in they prediction be the phenomenon of the `` shy Tory '' -- voter who do not wish to publicly proclaim they support for the Conservative Party but who , in the privacy of the voting booth , find they prefer it to any of the alternative . a highlight of the election campaign be a televised debate in which the three main party leader be quiz by a audience of voter . the highly articulate audience be very critical of Mr. Cameron . but it give the Labour leader , Ed Miliband , a even harder time . voter do the same on Thursday . nevertheless , while the Conservatives win last night , they take barely a third of the popular vote -- and they share be just 0.8 of a percentage point higher than in the 2010 election . even in Scotland , voter ' sentiment be shape as much by the party they despise as by the policy they like . it be unlikely that in the space of eight month , all those who vote `` no '' in September 's independence referendum have suddenly become enthusiastic nationalist . what seem to have create the s.n.p. swing be a deep disillusionment with the Labour Party that have be grow over many year , and finally engulf it on Thursday . all this will shape postelection british politics . the question of Scotland 's position within Britain and Britain 's relationship to the European Union will dominate . but both reflect a deeper issue : a nation that have become both more politically fragmented and more disenchanted with mainstream political institution . that be the paradox of a election that have seemingly produce a more decisive result than almost anyone predict .
